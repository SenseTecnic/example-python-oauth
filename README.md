This application demonstrates how to create a server-side application using python to access private data using OAuth2. We use Flask to create it. 

## Getting Started 

Install Flask using ``pip``. Flask is a microframework for Python applications (http://flask.pocoo.org/). 

```
pip install Flask
```

Install Flask OAuth, a Flask extension that uses ``oauthlib`` to interact with remote OAuth applications (https://github.com/lepture/flask-oauthlib)

```
pip install Flask-OAuthlib
```

## Running the application.

Running the application is easy, run:

```
python oauth-example.py
```

You can then access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
